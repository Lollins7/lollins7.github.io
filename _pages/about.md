I am a pre-graduate student at [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/). My research interest focuses on probabilistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification, generative AI and deep learning.

<!-- There are some of [mathematical notes](https://github.com/Lollins7/VSCode/tree/main/LaTeX/Notes) I took during my undergraduates studies to practice to use LaTeX. Meanwhile, I was writing a [note](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/699377272) recently about probabilistic machine learning. -->
