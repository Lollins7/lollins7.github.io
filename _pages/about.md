I am an undergraduate in [Anhui Normal University](https://www.ahnu.edu.cn/). My research interest focuses on control theory, multi-agent systems, probabilistic machine learning, operational research, numerical analysis and reinforcement learning.

There are some of [mathematical notes](https://github.com/Lollins7/VSCode/tree/main/LaTeX/Notes) I took during my undergraduates studies to practice to use LaTeX. Meanwhile, there are some [control course notes, reinforcement learning notes and probability statistics notes](https://github.com/Lollins7/VSCode/tree/main/Markdown/Notes) I have written using markdown. Moreover, I have also worked on a web scraping project before and wrote a piece of [crawler code](https://github.com/Lollins7/VSCode/blob/main/Python/fun%20code/%E5%AE%89%E5%B8%88%E5%A4%A7%E5%9B%BE%E4%B9%A6%E9%A6%86%E5%BA%A7%E4%BD%8D%E9%A2%84%E7%BA%A6.py) in order to conveniently book systems for my school library seats.
